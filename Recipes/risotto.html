    <h3>Risotto de setas</h3>

    <p>Traditional risotto of setas, or mushroom risotto, is a classic Italian dish that features Arborio rice cooked slowly in mushroom broth with white wine, onions, Parmesan cheese, and sautéed mushrooms.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup Arborio rice</li>
        <li>4 cups mushroom broth (or vegetable broth or chicken broth)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>1/2 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 cups sliced mushrooms (such as cremini or button mushrooms)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>

        <li>1. In a large saucepan, heat the mushroom broth over low heat and keep it warm.</li>
        <li>2. In a separate pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and garlic and sauté for 2-3 minutes until the onions become translucent.</li>
        <li>3. Add the sliced mushrooms to the pan with the onions and garlic and cook for about 5 minutes until the mushrooms are golden brown and tender. Remove the pan from heat and set it aside.</li>
        <li>4. In a large saucepan or Dutch oven, melt the butter over medium heat.</li>
        <li>5. Add the Arborio rice to the saucepan and toast for about 2-3 minutes until the rice is lightly golden, stirring constantly.</li>
        <li>6. Pour in the white wine and stir until the wine is absorbed by the rice.</li>
        <li>7. Add one cup of the warm mushroom broth to the rice and stir constantly until the broth is absorbed by the rice. Repeat this step with another cup of broth and continue stirring.</li>
        <li>8. After the second cup of broth has been absorbed, add the cooked mushrooms to the risotto and continue adding the broth one cup at a time, stirring constantly.</li>
        <li>9. Keep adding the broth and stirring the rice for about 20-25 minutes or until the rice is cooked to a creamy and tender consistency.</li>
        <li>10. Once the risotto has reached the desired consistency, remove it from heat and stir in the grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>11. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper if necessary.</li>
        <li>12. Serve hot, garnished with additional grated Parmesan cheese and chopped fresh herbs if desired.</li>
